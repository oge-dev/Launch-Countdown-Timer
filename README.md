# Frontend Mentor - Launch Countdown Timer Solution

This repository contains my solution to the [Launch Countdown Timer challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/launch-countdown-timer-N0XkGfyz-). Completing this challenge has strengthened my skills in creating interactive UI components with JavaScript and styling with SCSS.

## Overview

The Launch Countdown Timer project is a dynamic web component where users can observe a live countdown timer that updates every second. The project also includes interactive hover states for all interactive elements, with an optional flipping card animation for added visual appeal.

## Challenge

### Requirements
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## Solution

- **Solution URL**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oge-dev/Launch-Countdown-Timer)
- **Live Demo**: [Live Site](https://oge-dev.github.io/Launch-Countdown-Timer/)

## Development Process

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for semantic structure
- **SASS** for streamlined and organized CSS
- **JavaScript** for countdown functionality and interactivity

### Key Learnings

Working on this project enhanced my understanding of:
- CSS `content` property and positioning for creative designs.
- SCSS for modular, reusable styling with variables and mixins.
- JavaScript countdown logic and DOM manipulation.

Hereâ€™s an example of the SCSS mixin and nesting structure used in this project:

```scss
$White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
$Grayish-blue: hsl(237, 18%, 59%);
$Soft-red: hsl(345, 95%, 68%);
@mixin center-content {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
@mixin font-content(
  $textTransform,
  $size,
  $weight,
  $wordSpacing,
  $letterSpacing
) {
  text-transform: $textTransform;
  font-size: $size;
  font-weight: $weight;
  word-spacing: $wordSpacing;
  letter-spacing: $letterSpacing;
}

body {
  color: $White;
  @include center-content;
}

main {
  h1 {
    @include font-content(uppercase, 1.6rem, 700, 0.4rem, 0.5rem);
  }
  footer {
    .social-icons {
      @include center-content;
      gap: 2rem;
      a {
        color: $Grayish-blue;
        &:hover {
          color: $Soft-red;
          transition: all 0.4s ease-in-out;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Future Enhancements

To further develop this project, I plan to:
- Integrate it into an existing website or web application.
- Experiment with additional animations for the countdown cards.
